## Version Support

Code for version 1.5 exists within the repo, but the published uses the latest code (which only supports 1.6). There is currently *no branch* pointing to that last working 1.5 commit.

## Android/iOS/NSW Support

Both Android & iOS are supported. However, only SDV 1.6 is currently supported, so both mobile versions are currently unsupported (until they are updated to 1.6).

SDV on Nintendo Switch is unsupported.
